# Hey Gigi!

Welcome to **Hey Gigi!**, the web app designed to help you study and understand difficult concepts in a fun, engaging, and supportive way! We understand that studying can be tough, especially when you're juggling attention span challenges or struggling to focus. That’s why we’ve built this app with a unique twist: learning like you’re gossiping with friends!

Hey Gigi! uses the **Google Gemini API** for intelligent study assistance and **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech** and **Speech-To-Text** to simulate a voice call experience. The front end is built with React.js, while the back end is powered by MongoDB.

## The Problem
- **Difficulty staying focused**: Many students struggle to stay attentive due to short attention spans, ADHD, or the overwhelming nature of traditional study methods.
- **Lack of engagement**: Traditional study techniques can feel boring or disconnected, leading to disengagement and reduced retention of information.
- **Exclusion in learning environments**: Girls and underrepresented genders in tech often face unique barriers, including a lack of representation and supportive communities in study settings.
- **Challenging complex concepts**: Difficult concepts can feel inaccessible without the right tools or support to break them down in an understandable, relatable way.

## The Solution
The inspiration for **Hey Gigi!** stems from the playful, "bestie" vibes of shows like *Gossip Girl*, aiming to create a friendly, approachable atmosphere, while incorporating a more studious and thoughtful atmosphere of shows like *Gilmore Girls*. We also realized how difficult it can be to stay engaged and study effectively, particularly for people with short attention spans or ADHD. Additionally, women and gender minorities in tech often face intimidation and insecurity when voicing their questions or concerns. Recognizing these challenges, we saw an opportunity to create a space where everyone can feel comfortable asking questions and engaging without fear of judgment. Thus, "Hey Gigi!" was born — the perfect solution to bridge these gaps.

Here’s how we do it:

- **Conversational Learning**: Instead of struggling through dense textbooks, discuss difficult concepts in a casual, engaging way—just like gossiping with friends.
- **A Friendly AI Study Buddy**: Gigi interacts with you like a friend, making learning feel warm, personal, and non-intimidating. No more stress—just relaxed, productive conversations.
- **Effortless Voice & Chat Features**: Whether you prefer typing or talking, our easy-to-use call and chat functions help you engage with concepts however you’re most comfortable.
- **Inclusive and Supportive Environment**: We’ve designed this space to be welcoming for everyone, especially girls, underrepresented genders in tech, and those who struggle with traditional learning methods.

With  **Hey Gigi!**, we’re making gossip useful—turning everyday conversation into a powerful tool for learning, growth, and success.
