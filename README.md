# Hey Gigi!

Welcome to **Hey Gigi!**, the web app designed to help you study and understand difficult concepts in a fun, engaging, and supportive way! We understand that studying can be tough, especially when you're juggling attention span challenges or struggling to focus. That’s why we’ve built this app with a unique twist: learning like you’re gossiping with friends!

## The Problem
- **Difficulty staying focused**: Many students struggle to stay attentive due to short attention spans, ADHD, or the overwhelming nature of traditional study methods.
- **Lack of engagement**: Traditional study techniques can feel boring or disconnected, leading to disengagement and reduced retention of information.
- **Exclusion in learning environments**: Girls and underrepresented genders in tech often face unique barriers, including a lack of representation and supportive communities in study settings.
- **Challenging complex concepts**: Difficult concepts can feel inaccessible without the right tools or support to break them down in an understandable, relatable way.

## The Solution
**Hey Gigi!** transforms studying by tapping into the one thing that effortlessly holds our attention: gossip. We naturally stay engaged when chatting informally, so why not use that power to make learning easier, more fun, and actually useful in our lives?

Here’s how we do it:

- **Conversational Learning**: Instead of struggling through dense textbooks, discuss difficult concepts in a casual, engaging way—just like gossiping with friends.
- **A Friendly AI Study Buddy**: Gigi interacts with you like a friend, making learning feel warm, personal, and non-intimidating. No more stress—just relaxed, productive conversations.
- **Effortless Voice & Chat Features**: Whether you prefer typing or talking, our easy-to-use call and chat functions help you engage with concepts however you’re most comfortable.
- **Inclusive and Supportive Environment**: We’ve designed this space to be welcoming for everyone, especially girls, underrepresented genders in tech, and those who struggle with traditional learning methods.

With  **Hey Gigi!**, we’re making gossip useful—turning everyday conversation into a powerful tool for learning, growth, and success.
